Starting to show some evolution, expressive notes of black fruit, oak and spice meld together in this beautiful 2011 vintage, intensifying with light aeration. This Saint-Julien is fine and elegant with a juicy tannic structure. Aromas of black fruit and spices dominate, revealing notes of liquorice on the persistent finish.  Vintage Notes: Precision in working the soil in dry years is essential. Accompanied by leaf thinning, this limits water evaporation from the soil and the vine. Our new optical sorter allowed for precise selection of naturally concentrated grape berries. The sorter is calibrated for each variety, and is able to eliminate any unripe grapes. Pre-fermentation cold macerations revealed the purity of the fruit and aromas.

This vintage is the perfect combination of intensity and delicious fruit.

High water stress in the vineyard early September blocked the ripening process, but a big rainstorm (45 mm of rain) on September 13th relaunched the evolution in the vineyard. The dry and warm weather lasted until the end of harvest thus auguring an exceptional vintage, both in terms of quality and quantity.

On aeration, more complex aromas of ripe black fruit emerge, smoky and toasty. The attack is clean and elegant on the palate, true velvet supported by silky tannins. Very good balance in a very fine and defined wine. The very long finish reveals notes of oak and liquorice.  Producer Notes: Made to the same rigorous standards as the First Wine, from grapes grown in the same vineyard, La Dame de Montrose is the estate’s second label. Supple and silky Merlot generally predominates in the varietal mix. Its very pronounced red fruit aromas and flavours reflect another expression of the terroir in a distinctive style which is less elaborately complex than that of the First Wine. Consistently reliable and reaching maturity sooner, the wine was created in 1983 in tribute to Yvonne Charmolüe, who ran Château Montrose single-handedly from 1944 to 1960. Production varies from one year to another but accounts on average for 40 à 45% of the total production of the Montrose vineyard.  Vintage Notes: 2015 started with a colder winter than in previous years. The start of the season, mild and quite sunny, favoured early bud burst. Quick and uniform flowering took place at the start of June thanks to the exceptional climatic conditions. June and July were dry, marked by water stress leading to a clear slow-down in the development of the vine. Véraison took place early and in a very uniform way between 21 July and 10 August. The showers in September gave us the measure, once again, of the qualities of our terroir: drainage was perfect, and the Cabernet Sauvignon on the plateau bordering the estuary benefited from a very beneficial drying wind. The grapes were of very good quality, and we further strengthened our ultra-precise plot selection, which sometimes involved several passes through a plot in the search for optimum ripeness.  Vineyard Notes: Blessed with undisputed natural assets combined with advantages nurtured over the centuries, Château Montrose has one of the region’s most privileged winegrowing terroirs. The 95-hectare (234-acres) vineyard surrounds the château, the winery and the outbuildings in a single continuous sweep, an exceptional and historically very rare feature. As well as making the vineyard easier to work, this unity means that it can be treated as a single entity, providing ideal conditions for efficient organisation and for monitoring the condition of each parcel. The Montrose terroir corresponds to what geologists call “elite cores”. Over millions of years, a complex process of geological layering resulted in the creation of outcrops, ideal for making fine wines and ensuring natural drainage towards the estuary. The soil on these terraces consists of gravel mixed with sand on the surface over a clay-rich subsoil in which natural reserves form at depth, providing the vines with the water they need.  Harvest Notes: Harvest started from 15 September with an increased team of pickers and continued at a sustained pace until 8 October when picking finished.  Winemaking: The vinification, respectful of the identity of our terroir, was tailor-made in tanks of sizes adapted to each of the 55 batches that make up our blending palette. To these were added 7 batches resulting from the precision work carried out at the press. At the time of blending, the richness of the batches allowed us to be extremely precise in the selection for the grand vin, the most drastic in 15 years.

The only appellation to contain twenty one Grands Crus Classés, fewer than 25 kilometres from Bordeaux, is one of the most renowned terroirs in the Bordeaux region. The character of a Margaux wine is best described as ‘an iron fist in a velvet glove’. The meagre terroir provides the wines with a wonderful structure of tannins, enabling them to develop magnificently over time whilst still retaining the charm and delicacy characteristic of a Margaux.  Vineyard Notes: Various geological studies carried out by top specialists have demonstrated the high-quality origins of our terroir: alluvial deposits of Garonne gravel dating from the Quaternary period provide the foundations for our vineyards. On these arid, eroded soils formed of alluvial deposits, Garonne gravel transported from the Pyrenees during the Quaternary period, topography formed in the shape of what are known in the Médoc as ‘croupes gravelleuses’, or gravel hilltops. They allow excess water to drain off and enable Cabernet Sauvignon, the primary grape variety, to express itself to the full. Giscours has three major hills, and blending these together is what gives Giscours wines their power and complexity.  Harvest Notes: We have been performing precise, meticulous intra-plot harvesting for several years. We identify the youngest vines, which we harvest first for their radiant aromas and fruity style. We then make several passes through each plot to harvest the grapes from the oldest vines as soon as they reach full ripeness. These add beautiful density to the wine and ensure hugely refined tannins.  Winemaking: Once they have been harvested, the grapes are sorted, gently de-stemmed, then sorted once again using optical sorting so that only the highest-quality grapes are used. We perform very respectful pre-fermentation cold maceration to enhance the fruity aromas before the alcoholic fermentation stage. This stage also takes place at low temperatures with gentle extraction, similar to an infusion, and shielded from the air to protect the fruit’s freshness.

We carefully removed all the suckers – twice – as well as the side shoots in order to help the vines cope with reduced water consumption. This led to perfectly well-nourished grapes. After excellent flowering in early June, summer was excessively dry. Just like many other great vintages, this called a halt to premature growth. Drought conditions had two major effects on the fruit: - small berries, meaning very low yields - gradual concentration of flavour compounds in the grapes, very promising in terms of quality.

The whole summer was dry and hot until 13th September, when heaven-sent rain brought much-needed water to the vines. 33 mm of rainfall covered the estate evenly, waking up the vines and kick-starting the ripening process.  Harvest Notes:  In 2016, picking began on 29th September and finished on 19th October. Yields were good, mainly as a result of good weather and short, even flowering. When the fruit was tasted on the vines, from the outset the vintage was recognised to be very promising without the grapes appearing overripe from the summer heat and drought. 2016 is a vintage with outstanding balance.",English,pll_66d6d67b19098,simple,,"Red Wine|France|France > Bordeaux|France > Bordeaux > Margaux|750ml",,,

Energetic and with fabulous substance, it displays consummate balance on the palate, with a magical radiance and a taffeta mouthfeel. Fruit, tannins and acidity all combine harmoniously.  Vintage Notes: Spring came early and invited the vines to grow strongly. The hot, dry weather brought a smile to the winegrowers’ faces, keeping disease at bay and raising hopes of an early harvest, often one of the keys to a very good vintage. Flowering took place particularly early, around mid-May, in very dry weather which often meant sparse clusters and small berries. Then nature changed its plans and sent us a muted summer, though we still nurtured the hope of a true Bordeaux vintage, mature but fresh and well-balanced. Showers throughout September raised fears of a threat to the health of the crop, but a timely Indian summer stabilised the situation. The grapes had to be sorted, of course, but our facilities have two sorting lines for precisely that purpose. Ultimately, the grapes that went into the vats were perfectly healthy and fully ripe. As in previous years, extraction was especially easy.  Vineyard Notes: 81 ha Certified Organic: Ecocert & Biodynamic: Biodyvin and Demeter Soils: Quaternary Gravel.

The nose adds to the appeal, offering a magical array of aromatics ranging from graphite and cedar-wood notes to aromas of wild fruit. The depth of flavour on the palate is underpinned by soft tannins and lovely acidity. The finish, which reveals subtle smoky notes, is amazingly long. In this vintage, Pontet-Canet shows once again that natural refinement is its finest jewel. 2019, without doubt, is a promise of voluptuousness for all wine lovers.  Vintage Notes: After quite a mild winter, the first leaves appeared on the vines at the beginning of April. Despite a very unusual cold snap in May, which slowed cane growth for some days, flowering ensued very quickly and uniformly. Then summer settled in and the first grapes began changing colour on July 23rd. A few much-awaited showers quickened the pace of this initial colour change and by the end of July, in just a few days, ripening was well underway. Harvest time approached in very promising conditions with the fruit presenting lovely crispness. On September 23rd in brilliant sunshine, the Merlot grapes were picked followed by the Cabernet Franc. In the very last days of September the “real” Medoc harvest began with the first crates of the princely Cabernet Sauvignon being picked.

Harvest date: 17 September - 6 October Drinking Window: 2019 - 2030","Producer Tasting Notes: The wine is a radiant crimson red. The highly promising, rich and expressive nose opens on blackcurrant and kirsch notes mingled with cedarwood and spice aromas. The succulent and precise palate, its rich texture underpinned by mature and creamy tannins, confirms the excellence of a great vintage. Blond tobacco and minty notes round off the long and substantial finish, underlining the wine’s perfect harmony.  Producer Notes: The product of an exceptional terroir, Pastourelle de Clerc Milon is the second wine of Château Clerc Milon, an 1855 Classified Growth at Pauillac. The pastourelle is a traditional dance which evokes a knight’s romantic encounter with a shepherdess: the name echoes the pair of dancers that adorn the label of the Grand Vin. Made of gold, enamel and pearls, this precious miniature from the Museum of Wine in Art at Château Mouton Rothschild belonged to Catherine II, the empress of Russia, and is inspired by characters of the Commedia dell’Arte. Baroness Philippine de Rothschild chose it as the Clerc Milon emblem because of her love of the theatre. A round and supple wine, Pastourelle de Clerc Milon charms with the elegant richness of its aromas and flavours. It is also living testimony to the considerable improvements in quality that have been achieved at the property since the arrival of Baron Philippe and his descendants.  Vintage Notes: In terms of the weather, although 2015 was slightly warmer than average, it was above all very dry (706 mm of rain, compared with an annual average of 862 mm), especially between February and July, from budbreak to veraison. As a result the berries remained small, which explains why the yield was rather low even though we had hopes of a normal crop after flowering. Rainfall in August and September was higher than average, which helped to prevent the ripening process from coming to a halt in a vineyard already stressed by the lack of water. As a result, the grapes matured at rather different rates from one plot to another, according to the variety, the age of the vines and the terroir.  Vineyard Notes: The vineyard is planted with five varieties typical of the region: Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Merlot (37%), Cabernet Franc (10%), Petit Verdot (2%) and Carmenere (1%). The average age of the vines is 53 years, probably one of the highest in the Medoc. Mostly planted before the development of clonal selection, they represent an exceptionally rich genetic resource. The vine density is high, ranging between 8,500 and 10,000 vines per hectare depending on the parcel. Environment-friendly integrated vinegrowing techniques are employed, keeping the use of pesticides to a minimum. In the vineyard itself, the close monitoring and strict parcel selection are on a par with those practised at Mouton Rothschild.  Harvest Notes: In order to ensure that each grape variety and each plot was picked at optimum maturity, the harvest period was the longest in living memory. It lasted 23 days between our three estates, from the first Merlot clusters on 14 September to the last Cabernet Sauvignon grapes on 6 October.  Winemaking: The grapes were magnificent and fermentation took place quickly.

Environment-friendly integrated vinegrowing techniques are employed, keeping the use of pesticides to a minimum. In the vineyard itself, the close monitoring and strict parcel selection are on a par with those practised at Mouton Rothschild.

The nose shows impressively ripe fruit, concentration, and complexity. This is the epitome of a wine made from grapes with just the right degree of maturity. The wine starts out generous, sweet, and broad-based on the palate, going on seamlessly to reveal increasing body and power. The class, breeding, and sophistication of the tannin are obvious. 2016 La Mission Haut-Brion is certainly the most complete and charming the cha^teau has made in a long time.  Producer Notes: Complex, full-bodied and rich… Cha^teau La Mission Haut-Brion red wines invites the most complimentary descriptions. Over the years, these wines have risen to the ranks of Premiers Grands Crus Classe´s (Classified First Growth vintages). Containing 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 43% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, the blend changes according to the vintage, but Cha^teau La Mission Haut- Brion red wine always retains its unparalleled charisma. A highly enchanting wine of great intensity, its complexity and the characteristic signature of its terroir with empyreumatic notes (cigar, chocolate, roasting, cedar wood, etc.) are its most seductive attributes. Round and generous on the palate, without a hint of aggression, it lengthens into silky tannins, so noticeable you will melt under its charm when you taste it.  Vineyard Notes:  Despite a winter and a spring marked by complicated climatic conditions - abundant rain and temperatures below seasonal averages - flowering took place with an almost miraculous homogeneity. The great drought of the summer ended with a rainy season in mid-September that was very beneficial for the end of the maturity cycle. In October, no rain came to disrupt our harvest. The freshness of the nights, combined with the warm days, allowed to develop wines rich in color but also fresh and fruity. Paradox or miracle of nature? We would rather think it is the combination of human effort and, in particular, once again, the exceptional terroir.  Winemaking:  The grapes harvested and the berries placed in vats, the temperature rises… Now it is time for fermentation to begin. Thanks to technology and precise temperature control, the fermentation is fully controlled. Two weeks later, when the colours, tannins and main aromas have contributed their full potential, it’s time to drain the vats.

Once the wine is put into vat, the crushed grapes start to ferment thanks to the presence of yeast. The skins and pips float to the surface and form a cap above the must (fermenting grape juice). The vats are pumped over daily to extract colouring matter and aromas from this cap. Pumping over consists in spraying the cap with must taken from the bottom of the vat.  Ageing: For the first 3 or 4 months, the barrels are kept with a glass bung on top. As the new oak absorbs a lot of wine at the beginning of ageing, the amount that evaporates is replaced twice a week in a process called topping up. After this period, we close the barrels with a wooden bung and we store it “bung on the side» to limit the evaporation and protect the wine from oxidation.

This supple wine has body and substance. It is a monumental wine with great power and impressive architecture.

However, some real gems were still made despite the challenges.  The growing season began moderately, but the weather conditions quickly turned in April when vicious bouts of frost relentlessly struck the region and temperatures dipped to icy lows. The biting frosts caused significant damage to various producers’ crops; location, financial means, technology and knowledge were all paramount as to who was able to most successfully mitigate losses. Thankfully, the weather improved with the arrival of summer, although June was still shaky, delivering sporadic bouts of rain followed by heat spikes.

The summer months were so hot and dry, they cleared away any lingering rot, and the full water table in the soils became a key resource in keeping the vines hydrated. The heat helped push the grapes to phenolic ripeness and although portions of the crop had been lost to the earlier bouts of rot and disease, the surviving fruit tended to be in excellent health.

This extraordinary complexity results from the mosaic of identities of its 21 cadastered plots in the Pomerol appellation, to the French border of St. Emilion.  Vintage Notes:  Budding was a little late but a beautiful spring, with low rainfall and ideal temperatures brought us up to speed. Flowering took place at the normal date in early June. It was homogeneous and short, and stretched over one week. June was warm and sunny. At the beginning of July, a few storms compensate a small drought, the vines grew in good conditions. In late August, some rain brought the necessary moisture.  Vineyard Notes:  The Pomerol appellation encompasses a multitude of micro-terroirs. What makes Château Le Bon Pasteur, with a total surface area of 6.7 hectares, so unusual is that it is located on the border between two world-famous regions: Pomerol and Saint-Emilion. As opposed to the great châteaux of the Médoc, the vineyard is not in a single block, but spread out over 21 plots. This patchwork of terroirs accounts for the wine’s considerable complexity, deep colour and delicate bouquet, as well as a softness typical of Pomerol and a generous, powerful side reminiscent of Saint-Emilion.  Harvest Notes: Harvesting took place from September 21st until October 10th. Thanks to a well-mastered yield control, the grapes were picked under excellent conditions. They were full of sugar and fruit with thick skins loaded with anthocyanins and tannins, acidity was very good, and the grapes were perfectly healthy.

This extraordinary complexity results from the mosaic of identities of its 21 cadastered plots in the Pomerol appellation, to the French border of St. Emilion.  Vintage Notes:  Budding was a little late but a beautiful spring, with low rainfall and ideal temperatures brought us up to speed. Flowering took place at the normal date in early June. It was homogeneous and short, and stretched over one week. June was warm and sunny. At the beginning of July, a few storms compensate a small drought, the vines grew in good conditions. In late August, some rain brought the necessary moisture.  Vineyard Notes:  The Pomerol appellation encompasses a multitude of micro-terroirs. What makes Château Le Bon Pasteur, with a total surface area of 6.7 hectares, so unusual is that it is located on the border between two world-famous regions: Pomerol and Saint-Emilion. As opposed to the great châteaux of the Médoc, the vineyard is not in a single block, but spread out over 21 plots. This patchwork of terroirs accounts for the wine’s considerable complexity, deep colour and delicate bouquet, as well as a softness typical of Pomerol and a generous, powerful side reminiscent of Saint-Emilion.  Harvest Notes: Harvesting took place from September 21st until October 10th. Thanks to a well-mastered yield control, the grapes were picked under excellent conditions. They were full of sugar and fruit with thick skins loaded with anthocyanins and tannins, acidity was very good, and the grapes were perfectly healthy.

Producer Notes: Purchased by Jean-Pierre Moueix in 1953, Château Trotanoy has been considered one of the premier crus of Pomerol since the end of the eighteenth century. The soil of Château Trotanoy is a very dense mixture of clay and gra- vel which tends to solidify as it dries out after rain to an almost concrete-like hardness, hence the name “Trotanoy,” or, in other words, “too wearisome” to cultivate.  Vineyard Notes: The Trotanoy vineyard slopes gently to the west. The soil at the highest point of exposure contains a good proportion of gravel, becoming progressively more dominated by clay as the elevation declines. Under this clay is a subsoil of red gravel and an impermeable layer of hard, iron-rich soil known as “crasse de fer.” This fascinating soil diversity brings power, depth and complexity to the wine.

The Trotanoy vineyard, located in one of the best-exposed areas of the plateau and spared, in part, by the dramatic frosts of 1956, slopes gently to the west. The soil is a very dense mixture of clay and gravel which tends to solidify as it dries out after rain to an almost concrete-like hardness, hence the name “Trot-anoy,” -- “too wearisome” to cultivate.  Vineyard Notes: The soil at the highest point of exposure contains a good proportion of gravel, becoming progressively more dominated by clay as the elevation declines. Under this clay is a subsoil of red gravel and an impermeable layer of hard, iron-rich soil known as “crasse de fer.” This fascinating soil diversity brings power, depth and complexity to the wines.  Harvest Notes: Manual harvest. Double sorting: manual and optical.  Winemaking: In thermo-regulated concrete and stainless-steel vats. Gentle & controlled maceration & extraction.

Since its beginnings, it has benefited from an exceptional terroir, as well as being the result of a unique ancestral know-how since 1593.   2020 Chateau Haut-Brion Pessac-Leognan Producer Tasting Notes: The colour of this Château Haut-Brion is a dark, radiant red. Before swirling, the nose already reveals both fresh and spicy notes. Swirling the wine confirms good ripeness of the grapes, with no excess. The first taste is incredibly tightly-knit and precise. Straight away the wine is assertive, with instant presence. The development is never forceful, but what presence on the palate! The tactile sensations are completed by the taste, the flavours. The tannins are well-rounded, refined, juicy. Excellent length, even when the wine is no longer in the mouth. The musical score composed by the three grape varieties, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, is incredibly accurate and harmonious.  Vineyard Notes: Château Haut-Brion’s vineyard is located in the commune of Pessac, just a few miles southwest of Bordeaux’s city center. It belongs to the Pessac-Léognan appellation, to the north of the Graves wine-growing region. Château Haut-Brion is the only wine to be both First Growth from the 1855 classification and Classified Growth of the Graves.  Vintage Notes: Winter, then springtime 2020 were mild and wet, with a very early start to the vine’s growth cycle and budburst beginning on 17th February. This was the third earliest year in living memory at Château Haut-Brion. During spring, it was essential to pay very close attention to the vines. Flowering was early too. In summer, the heat and drought slowed down the vine’s growth and this enabled a slow ripening of the grapes, which were perfectly healthy at harvesting time. All these weather events created ideal conditions for making wines that are concentrated and fresh all at the same time.  Winemaking: The grape bunches harvested and the berries placed in vats, the temperature rises …. Now it is time for fermentation to begin. Thanks to technology and precise temperature control, the winemaker knows how to regulate these fermentations. Two weeks later, when the colour, tannins and aromatic components have given their full potential, it is time to run off the wine from the vats.  Ageing: 18 month   2020 Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion Pessac-Leognan Producer Tasting Notes: A beautiful dark purple hue. The first nose is intense and fascinating, full of red fruit aromas, with ripe and fresh notes simultaneously. Swirling the wine confirms the fruity, captivating powerfulness, enhanced by a superb woody, spicy hint. The first taste is round, fleshy and thick. The wine develops on a tightly-knit, juicy sensation on the palate, almost sweet, with full-body. It stretches out in length with an elegant presence of tannin, rich in taste and full of pleasure on the finish. This is a superb Château La Mission Haut-Brion, its blend wellbalanced and representative of the grape varieties planted in its vineyard.  Producer Notes: « 2020 is a unique vintage in every way. We had to be patient to wait for the ripeness we hoped for, but above all, 2020 will be remembered as a vintage with a very significant human factor. All these conditions make 2020 a remarkable vintage; concentrated wines, sustained by astonishing freshness enable La Mission Haut-Brion 2020 to be a huge success, in red as well as in white. » Jean-Philippe Delmas  Vineyard Notes: Château La Mission Haut-Brion’s vineyard stretches across land in the municipalities of both Talence and Pessac and is located just a few miles southwest of Bordeaux’s city center. It belongs to the Pessac-Léognan appellation, in the northern part of the Graves winegrowing area. The property stands opposite Château Haut-Brion and shares the same vast terrace of superb gravelly soils, ideal for cultivating vines, already referred to as “Haut-Brion” on ancient maps and deeds.  Vintage Notes: A rainy winter and springtime required swift responsiveness from the teams to go in to do their work in the vineyard at just the right moment. Subsequently, a drought took hold from the beginning of the summer and then, on the contrary, it was necessary to limit work in the vineyard as much as possible, so as to protect the vines from the sun. Two months without rain, interspersed by peaks of very high temperatures slowed down the vine’s growth somewhat and curbed its advance, even though ripeness was very early.  Harvest Notes: The harvests for white grapes began on 19th August, with the sun shining brightly. Given the heat, the main concern was to protect the grapes’ aromas: picking was done only in the mornings and refrigerated transport carried the grapes to the vat house. At the end of the month of August, harvests of white grapes were completed. A week later, they began for red grapes. This short interlude was necessary and beneficial to attain the perfect aromatic balance and ripeness of the red grapes. When picking them, the challenge was to work in the shade as much as possible, not only to protect the grapes, but the harvesters too. All these precautions and the teams’ patience paid off: on arrival at the vat house, few berries were discarded during sorting by density testing; this was a sign of consistent ripeness and a very healthy, promising crop. When fermentation was only just finished, the juices clearly showed the ripeness already observed in the vineyard.  Winemaking: The grapes harvested and the berries placed in vats, the temperature rises… Now it is time for fermentation to begin. Thanks to technology and precise temperature control, the fermentation is fully controlled. Two weeks later, when the colours, tannins and main aromas have contributed their full potential, it’s time to drain the vats.  Ageing: 16 month   2020 Chateau Mouton Rothschild Pauillac Producer Tasting Notes: The wine is a deep, dark, garnet-hued cherry red. The refined and complex nose opens on remarkablly ripe black fruit, going on with airing to reveal aromas of blackcurrant and aniseed combined with touches of flint and subtle cigar box. From a smooth yet full-bodied attack the palate displays highly precise tannins which strike a harmonious balance with the refinement of minty and smokey notes. Displaying mineral and black berry fruit notes, the complete and exceptionally long finish expresses all the nobility of Chateau Mouton Rothschild Cabernet Sauvignon.  Vineyard Notes: The Château Mouton Rothschild vineyard, mostly situated on a hillock called the “Plateau de Mouton” which rises to 27m above sea-level, is planted on very deep gravelly soil with the varieties typical of the region: Cabernet Sauvignon (81%), Merlot (15%), Cabernet Franc (3%) and Petit Verdot (1%). These proportions are not reflected identically in the wine, because the blend varies according to the character of each vintage. However, Cabernet Sauvignon always predominates: it is Cabernet Sauvignon that gives Mouton its rich tannins, its wealth of aroma and flavour and its ageing capacity, while Merlot, an inseparable companion, brings suppleness, roundness and exceptional length. As with other top Médoc wines, the vineyard is densely planted – 10,000 vines per hectare – and the average age of the vines is around 44 years.  Ageing: 18 month   2020 Chateau Lafite Rothschild Pauillac Vineyard Notes: The vineyard of Château Lafite Rothschild comprises three main areas: The slopes around the Château, the Carruades plateau to the west and a 4.5-hectare lot in the neighbouring township of Saint-Estèphe. The surface area is 112 hectares. The soil is made up of fine, deep gravel mixed with windblown sand on a well-drained, and well exposed tertiary limestone subsoil. The grape varieties grown here are Cabernet-Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot.  Ageing: 18 month   2020 Chateau Margaux Margaux Producer Tasting Notes: It owes its unique qualities to the genius of its terroir as well as to the passionate work of a succession of generations. It’s a remarkable wine that comes from a combination of characteristics that are only rarely found: finesse, elegance, complexity, density, intensity, length and freshness. Although its tannic concentration may be exceptional, it’s rare to detect astringency. The great vintages are distinguished by their formidable ability to move us. The lesser vintages give pleasure to wise enthusiasts. They offer the advantage of evolving very rapidly and, reveal, after a few years, instead of power, this subtlety that is the prerogative of great terroirs. Château Margaux has an extraordinary ability to evolve. Over the years, it has developed a finesse, an aromatic complexity and a remarkable presence on the palate.  Vintage Notes: As in the preceding vintages, 2020 saw average temperatures that were among the highest ever recorded due to a series of heatwaves and an exceptionally dry summer. Several factors contributed to making this a superb wine: homogenous flowering, summer conditions that favoured small berries and therefore concentrated wines, and excellent harvesting conditions. Only the yield was not as we had hoped. The fertility of the grape varieties was lower than in previous years, with 1.6 bunches per shoot, compared to 2 in 2019. The average yield on the estate was therefore 36 hl/ha.  Ageing: 22 month   2020 Chateau Ausone Saint-Emilion Producer Notes: Today, the 11th generation of the Vauthier family watches over this unique terroir of seven hectares on the hillside south of the village of Saint-Émilion. This historic estate, associated with the poet Ausone, dates back to Roman times. Our expert winegrowers pay meticulous attention to each vine, respecting an entire ecosystem. Every precise action from vineyard to cellar contributes to a single ambition: to give the terroir the most authentic expression possible.  Vineyard Notes: LOCATION: plateau and hillsides at the southern entrance to the village of Saint-Émilion. NATURE OF SOILS: clay-limestone with asteria.  Winemaking: Manual harvest with density sorting. Plot-by-plot vinification in small wooden vats. Gentle extraction controlled by gravity-fed rackand-return.

Ageing: 18 month   2020 Chateau Margaux Margaux Producer Tasting Notes: It owes its unique qualities to the genius of its terroir as well as to the passionate work of a succession of generations. It’s a remarkable wine that comes from a combination of characteristics that are only rarely found: finesse, elegance, complexity, density, intensity, length and freshness. Although its tannic concentration may be exceptional, it’s rare to detect astringency. The great vintages are distinguished by their formidable ability to move us. The lesser vintages give pleasure to wise enthusiasts. They offer the advantage of evolving very rapidly and, reveal, after a few years, instead of power, this subtlety that is the prerogative of great terroirs. Château Margaux has an extraordinary ability to evolve. Over the years, it has developed a finesse, an aromatic complexity and a remarkable presence on the palate.  Vintage Notes: As in the preceding vintages, 2020 saw average temperatures that were among the highest ever recorded due to a series of heatwaves and an exceptionally dry summer. Several factors contributed to making this a superb wine: homogenous flowering, summer conditions that favoured small berries and therefore concentrated wines, and excellent harvesting conditions. Only the yield was not as we had hoped. The fertility of the grape varieties was lower than in previous years, with 1.6 bunches per shoot, compared to 2 in 2019. The average yield on the estate was therefore 36 hl/ha.  Ageing: 22 month   2020 Chateau Ausone Saint-Emilion Producer Notes: Today, the 11th generation of the Vauthier family watches over this unique terroir of seven hectares on the hillside south of the village of Saint-Émilion. This historic estate, associated with the poet Ausone, dates back to Roman times. Our expert winegrowers pay meticulous attention to each vine, respecting an entire ecosystem. Every precise action from vineyard to cellar contributes to a single ambition: to give the terroir the most authentic expression possible.  Vineyard Notes: LOCATION: plateau and hillsides at the southern entrance to the village of Saint-Émilion. NATURE OF SOILS: clay-limestone with asteria.  Winemaking: Manual harvest with density sorting. Plot-by-plot vinification in small wooden vats. Gentle extraction controlled by gravity-fed rackand-return.

Since its beginnings, it has benefited from an exceptional terroir, as well as being the result of a unique ancestral know-how since 1593.   2020 Chateau Haut-Brion Pessac-Leognan Producer Tasting Notes: The colour of this Château Haut-Brion is a dark, radiant red. Before swirling, the nose already reveals both fresh and spicy notes. Swirling the wine confirms good ripeness of the grapes, with no excess. The first taste is incredibly tightly-knit and precise. Straight away the wine is assertive, with instant presence. The development is never forceful, but what presence on the palate! The tactile sensations are completed by the taste, the flavours. The tannins are well-rounded, refined, juicy. Excellent length, even when the wine is no longer in the mouth. The musical score composed by the three grape varieties, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, is incredibly accurate and harmonious.  Vineyard Notes: Château Haut-Brion’s vineyard is located in the commune of Pessac, just a few miles southwest of Bordeaux’s city center. It belongs to the Pessac-Léognan appellation, to the north of the Graves wine-growing region. Château Haut-Brion is the only wine to be both First Growth from the 1855 classification and Classified Growth of the Graves.  Vintage Notes: Winter, then springtime 2020 were mild and wet, with a very early start to the vine’s growth cycle and budburst beginning on 17th February. This was the third earliest year in living memory at Château Haut-Brion. During spring, it was essential to pay very close attention to the vines. Flowering was early too. In summer, the heat and drought slowed down the vine’s growth and this enabled a slow ripening of the grapes, which were perfectly healthy at harvesting time. All these weather events created ideal conditions for making wines that are concentrated and fresh all at the same time.  Winemaking: The grape bunches harvested and the berries placed in vats, the temperature rises …. Now it is time for fermentation to begin. Thanks to technology and precise temperature control, the winemaker knows how to regulate these fermentations. Two weeks later, when the colour, tannins and aromatic components have given their full potential, it is time to run off the wine from the vats.  Ageing: 18 month   2020 Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion Pessac-Leognan Producer Tasting Notes: A beautiful dark purple hue. The first nose is intense and fascinating, full of red fruit aromas, with ripe and fresh notes simultaneously. Swirling the wine confirms the fruity, captivating powerfulness, enhanced by a superb woody, spicy hint. The first taste is round, fleshy and thick. The wine develops on a tightly-knit, juicy sensation on the palate, almost sweet, with full-body. It stretches out in length with an elegant presence of tannin, rich in taste and full of pleasure on the finish. This is a superb Château La Mission Haut-Brion, its blend wellbalanced and representative of the grape varieties planted in its vineyard.  Producer Notes: « 2020 is a unique vintage in every way. We had to be patient to wait for the ripeness we hoped for, but above all, 2020 will be remembered as a vintage with a very significant human factor. All these conditions make 2020 a remarkable vintage; concentrated wines, sustained by astonishing freshness enable La Mission Haut-Brion 2020 to be a huge success, in red as well as in white. » Jean-Philippe Delmas  Vineyard Notes: Château La Mission Haut-Brion’s vineyard stretches across land in the municipalities of both Talence and Pessac and is located just a few miles southwest of Bordeaux’s city center. It belongs to the Pessac-Léognan appellation, in the northern part of the Graves winegrowing area. The property stands opposite Château Haut-Brion and shares the same vast terrace of superb gravelly soils, ideal for cultivating vines, already referred to as “Haut-Brion” on ancient maps and deeds.  Vintage Notes: A rainy winter and springtime required swift responsiveness from the teams to go in to do their work in the vineyard at just the right moment. Subsequently, a drought took hold from the beginning of the summer and then, on the contrary, it was necessary to limit work in the vineyard as much as possible, so as to protect the vines from the sun. Two months without rain, interspersed by peaks of very high temperatures slowed down the vine’s growth somewhat and curbed its advance, even though ripeness was very early.  Harvest Notes: The harvests for white grapes began on 19th August, with the sun shining brightly. Given the heat, the main concern was to protect the grapes’ aromas: picking was done only in the mornings and refrigerated transport carried the grapes to the vat house. At the end of the month of August, harvests of white grapes were completed. A week later, they began for red grapes. This short interlude was necessary and beneficial to attain the perfect aromatic balance and ripeness of the red grapes. When picking them, the challenge was to work in the shade as much as possible, not only to protect the grapes, but the harvesters too. All these precautions and the teams’ patience paid off: on arrival at the vat house, few berries were discarded during sorting by density testing; this was a sign of consistent ripeness and a very healthy, promising crop. When fermentation was only just finished, the juices clearly showed the ripeness already observed in the vineyard.  Winemaking: The grapes harvested and the berries placed in vats, the temperature rises… Now it is time for fermentation to begin. Thanks to technology and precise temperature control, the fermentation is fully controlled. Two weeks later, when the colours, tannins and main aromas have contributed their full potential, it’s time to drain the vats.  Ageing: 16 month   2020 Chateau Mouton Rothschild Pauillac Producer Tasting Notes: The wine is a deep, dark, garnet-hued cherry red. The refined and complex nose opens on remarkablly ripe black fruit, going on with airing to reveal aromas of blackcurrant and aniseed combined with touches of flint and subtle cigar box. From a smooth yet full-bodied attack the palate displays highly precise tannins which strike a harmonious balance with the refinement of minty and smokey notes. Displaying mineral and black berry fruit notes, the complete and exceptionally long finish expresses all the nobility of Chateau Mouton Rothschild Cabernet Sauvignon.  Vineyard Notes: The Château Mouton Rothschild vineyard, mostly situated on a hillock called the “Plateau de Mouton” which rises to 27m above sea-level, is planted on very deep gravelly soil with the varieties typical of the region: Cabernet Sauvignon (81%), Merlot (15%), Cabernet Franc (3%) and Petit Verdot (1%). These proportions are not reflected identically in the wine, because the blend varies according to the character of each vintage. However, Cabernet Sauvignon always predominates: it is Cabernet Sauvignon that gives Mouton its rich tannins, its wealth of aroma and flavour and its ageing capacity, while Merlot, an inseparable companion, brings suppleness, roundness and exceptional length. As with other top Médoc wines, the vineyard is densely planted – 10,000 vines per hectare – and the average age of the vines is around 44 years.  Ageing: 18 month   2020 Chateau Lafite Rothschild Pauillac Vineyard Notes: The vineyard of Château Lafite Rothschild comprises three main areas: The slopes around the Château, the Carruades plateau to the west and a 4.5-hectare lot in the neighbouring township of Saint-Estèphe. The surface area is 112 hectares. The soil is made up of fine, deep gravel mixed with windblown sand on a well-drained, and well exposed tertiary limestone subsoil. The grape varieties grown here are Cabernet-Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot.

Vivacious, intense and harmonious with great tension on the palate, expressing notes of quince, candied fruits and citrus, yellow kiwi, star fruit, honey, apple tart, butter cookies, orange peel, peony and fennel, with floral and menthol undertones.

Producer Notes: Krug Vintage is created as Joseph wrote, “according to the circumstances.” In the House of Krug, Krug Vintage is not the selection of the best wines of a good year, but the selection of the wines which better express the story of the year, those wines which better play the music of the year. The creation is then enhanced by a stay over ten years in Krug’s cellars.  Vintage Notes: The year 2008 was one of hampagne’s coolest in 14 years, and also one of the region’s least sunny in almost half a century. It was a classic northern climate, one that has not been seen much since. Rainfall was normal, the summer was dry, and temperatures were constant throughout the growing season.

Krug 2008 exhibits both power and elegance with a textured and intense mouthfeel very characteristic of the year’s wines, which uniquely reconciled intensity and quality.

"2015 Pierre Bertrand Blanc de Blancs Brut Champagne",2015-pierre-bertrand-blanc-de-blancs-brut-champagne,26553,"Dosage: Brut Sweetness: Dry","Vintage Notes: Champagne enjoyed a glittering 2015 vintage.  The growing season was notable for being the hottest vintage ever recorded. The hot conditions did make drought an issue and some yields were reduced by 20 percent, with berries failing to grow properly. However, the hot, dry conditions did prevent the development of disease and rot and producers were often spared from using sprays and pesticides. A few have commented that these unusual circumstances meant their wines ended up adhering to organic standards purely through circumstance rather than actual trying. The intensely hot weather ran from June through to August with the end of August seeing a touch of relieving rain along with cooler nights. Along with being one of the hottest growing seasons on record, it was also one of the shortest. The harvest began late August and continued into the September.

A cold winter, chilly spring and dank summer made for a fairly poor growing season until conditions did an about-turn, particularly in Ambonnay, Bouzy and Aÿ. Suddenly, the weather was delivering bright, dry, sunny days which helped push the grapes towards phenolic ripeness despite temperatures still being lower than normal. The freezing winter also served to fully hibernate the vines so when the steadier weather eventually came, the grapes were in good health to take full advantage of the idyllic conditions. The cooler than average growing season also allowed grapes to ripen slowly preserving much-needed acidity.  Despite the inauspicious start, the end results for Champagne were surprisingly excellent. The harvest was successful and the resulting wines were fresh and refined with rich, ripe fruit and balanced acidity.  The only other hiccup the vintage faced was the devastating 2008 global recession, which decimated prices. Although Champagne undoubtedly financially suffered in the dire economic climate, the vintage itself is widely regarded as superb – for some, it was even legendary. Many wines will still be drinking very well now with the best likely to cellar even further.

"2021 Antoine Lienhardt Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru Cote de Nuits",2021-antoine-lienhardt-clos-de-vougeot-grand-cru-cote-de-nuits,26763,,"Vintage Notes:  The 2021 Burgundy vintage was largely a mixed bag, which is mostly down to the wild and unpredictable weather that blighted the growing season.  The growing season began off the back of an unusually balmy winter – mild, wet winters appear to be Burgundy's new norm as a result of climate change – which initiated both early vine growth and budbreak. Unfortunately, the early arrival of the new vine growth left it susceptible to the elements and come the elements did. April saw temperatures take a sharp dive and a vicious frost set in, its icy grip wreaked havoc on the vines causing particular damage to Chardonnay. To add further insult to injury, snow than followed.  Summer continued in a depressingly damp vein with the intermittent rains making rot and disease like mildew a very real threat. However, June finally saw temperatures rise and there were enough sunny days to dry out the vines, reducing the risk of disease. Although June's warmth prompted an early flowering, regional hail, however, than struck which again caused damage.  Heavy rain suddenly became the order of the day with little sunshine – or relief – throughout both July and August, this meant vignerons had to be vigilant when it came to keeping both rot and disease at bay. The weather finally eased before véraison and the fruit was finally allowed to dry out. Although the fruit did ripen – unusually the reds were quicker to ripen then the whites – the earlier stresses of hail, frost and rain had taken their toll resulting in one of Burgundy's smallest ever vintages.  Overall, it is likely that the 2021 vintage for Burgundy will be far more a vintage for reds than for whites as yields for whites were heavily reduced – although yields for reds were not high either. The quality of what was made, however, is said to be very good. One thing perhaps going in favor of this vintage is that the cooler-than-usual growing season failed to beat high alcohol into the grapes – as has been the case in recent years – leaving instead an arguably more refined style more closely aligned with classic Burgundy.

"2020 Antoine Lienhardt Cote de Nuits-Villages Aux Vignottes Burgundy",2020-antoine-lienhardt-cote-de-nuits-villages-aux-vignottes-burgundy,26765,,"Vintage Notes:  Although it is still too early to give a definitive assessment on the vintage, most reports suggest the 2020 Burgundy vintage is shaping up to be superb. The 2020 vintage was unusual for two reasons: first the Covid pandemic that swept the world, and then for its unusually high temperatures, a possible result of climate change.  The growing season began with an unusually mild winter, which transitioned into a balmy spring. However, despite the relative warmth, various bouts of frost struck in the subsequent months with Chablis particularly affected although damage was kept to a minimum. Consistent warm weather eventually prevailed, cumulating into an unnaturally warm April, which prompted both an early budburst and flowering. For some places like the Côte d'Or, this set the scene for a rapid growing season.  A hot, dry summer eventually arrived, and conditions became so arid at times that drought became a looming threat – although cleansing winds breezed through the vineyards, which helped keep the vines free from disease. The conditions tended to be more conducive to the successful development of Pinot Noir, which experienced fewer problems with millerandage and coulure than Chardonnay.  The dry summer heat was, at times, taxing on the grapes and by August vines were beginning to suffer, although there were a few patches of localized rain, which helped relieve regions like Chablis. One advantage of the dry conditions was that it prevented hail from making an appearance along with diseases like rot and mildew that rely on a certain level of moisture being present.  Producers had to manage a different set of problems from previous years where disease can be more prevalent. This year, producers had to be on the watch out for sunburned grapes and overly raisined fruit.  The fast-growing season naturally led to an early harvest with picking beginning in the Mâconnais mid-August and some estates even had the entire harvest for both red and white in by the end of the month, which is almost unheard of. Another unique aspect was the order of picking, traditionally whites are nearly always picked first as they tend to ripen before the reds but, in this instance, Chardonnay was slower in reaching full phenolic ripeness than Pinot Noir and the reds were mostly picked first. Additionally, there were the extra precautions like social distancing put in place to tackle Covid, which had to be adhered to during picking.  Although the harvest was not a unanimous success as some producers lost significant yields, particularly Pinot Noir, to the intense summer heat, the quality of the surviving grapes looks set to be high.  On balance, producers have high hopes for their wines. The whites are said to be both aromatic and fresh, while the reds are said to be both complex and structured, if a little higher in alcohol than normal.  Overall, the 2020 vintage was an interesting year for Burgundy as the region had to contend with both an arid growing season and a global pandemic which made having general tastings difficult.

The 2020 vintage was unusual for two reasons: first the Covid pandemic that swept the world, and then for its unusually high temperatures, a possible result of climate change.  The growing season began with an unusually mild winter, which transitioned into a balmy spring. However, despite the relative warmth, various bouts of frost struck in the subsequent months with Chablis particularly affected although damage was kept to a minimum. Consistent warm weather eventually prevailed, cumulating into an unnaturally warm April, which prompted both an early budburst and flowering. For some places like the Côte d'Or, this set the scene for a rapid growing season.  A hot, dry summer eventually arrived, and conditions became so arid at times that drought became a looming threat – although cleansing winds breezed through the vineyards, which helped keep the vines free from disease. The conditions tended to be more conducive to the successful development of Pinot Noir, which experienced fewer problems with millerandage and coulure than Chardonnay.  The dry summer heat was, at times, taxing on the grapes and by August vines were beginning to suffer, although there were a few patches of localized rain, which helped relieve regions like Chablis. One advantage of the dry conditions was that it prevented hail from making an appearance along with diseases like rot and mildew that rely on a certain level of moisture being present.  Producers had to manage a different set of problems from previous years where disease can be more prevalent. This year, producers had to be on the watch out for sunburned grapes and overly raisined fruit.  The fast-growing season naturally led to an early harvest with picking beginning in the Mâconnais mid-August and some estates even had the entire harvest for both red and white in by the end of the month, which is almost unheard of. Another unique aspect was the order of picking, traditionally whites are nearly always picked first as they tend to ripen before the reds but, in this instance, Chardonnay was slower in reaching full phenolic ripeness than Pinot Noir and the reds were mostly picked first. Additionally, there were the extra precautions like social distancing put in place to tackle Covid, which had to be adhered to during picking.  Although the harvest was not a unanimous success as some producers lost significant yields, particularly Pinot Noir, to the intense summer heat, the quality of the surviving grapes looks set to be high.  On balance, producers have high hopes for their wines. The whites are said to be both aromatic and fresh, while the reds are said to be both complex and structured, if a little higher in alcohol than normal.  Overall, the 2020 vintage was an interesting year for Burgundy as the region had to contend with both an arid growing season and a global pandemic which made having general tastings difficult.

"2020 Au Pied du Mont Chauve Bourgogne Pinot Noir Burgundy",2020-au-pied-du-mont-chauve-bourgogne-pinot-noir-burgundy,26783,"Alcohol ABV: 13 - 14%","Vintage Notes:  Although it is still too early to give a definitive assessment on the vintage, most reports suggest the 2020 Burgundy vintage is shaping up to be superb. The 2020 vintage was unusual for two reasons: first the Covid pandemic that swept the world, and then for its unusually high temperatures, a possible result of climate change.  The growing season began with an unusually mild winter, which transitioned into a balmy spring. However, despite the relative warmth, various bouts of frost struck in the subsequent months with Chablis particularly affected although damage was kept to a minimum. Consistent warm weather eventually prevailed, cumulating into an unnaturally warm April, which prompted both an early budburst and flowering. For some places like the Côte d'Or, this set the scene for a rapid growing season.  A hot, dry summer eventually arrived, and conditions became so arid at times that drought became a looming threat – although cleansing winds breezed through the vineyards, which helped keep the vines free from disease. The conditions tended to be more conducive to the successful development of Pinot Noir, which experienced fewer problems with millerandage and coulure than Chardonnay.  The dry summer heat was, at times, taxing on the grapes and by August vines were beginning to suffer, although there were a few patches of localized rain, which helped relieve regions like Chablis. One advantage of the dry conditions was that it prevented hail from making an appearance along with diseases like rot and mildew that rely on a certain level of moisture being present.  Producers had to manage a different set of problems from previous years where disease can be more prevalent. This year, producers had to be on the watch out for sunburned grapes and overly raisined fruit.  The fast-growing season naturally led to an early harvest with picking beginning in the Mâconnais mid-August and some estates even had the entire harvest for both red and white in by the end of the month, which is almost unheard of. Another unique aspect was the order of picking, traditionally whites are nearly always picked first as they tend to ripen before the reds but, in this instance, Chardonnay was slower in reaching full phenolic ripeness than Pinot Noir and the reds were mostly picked first. Additionally, there were the extra precautions like social distancing put in place to tackle Covid, which had to be adhered to during picking.  Although the harvest was not a unanimous success as some producers lost significant yields, particularly Pinot Noir, to the intense summer heat, the quality of the surviving grapes looks set to be high.  On balance, producers have high hopes for their wines. The whites are said to be both aromatic and fresh, while the reds are said to be both complex and structured, if a little higher in alcohol than normal.  Overall, the 2020 vintage was an interesting year for Burgundy as the region had to contend with both an arid growing season and a global pandemic which made having general tastings difficult.

The growing season began off the back of an unusually balmy winter – mild, wet winters appear to be Burgundy's new norm as a result of climate change – which initiated both early vine growth and budbreak. Unfortunately, the early arrival of the new vine growth left it susceptible to the elements and come the elements did. April saw temperatures take a sharp dive and a vicious frost set in, its icy grip wreaked havoc on the vines causing particular damage to Chardonnay. To add further insult to injury, snow than followed.  Summer continued in a depressingly damp vein with the intermittent rains making rot and disease like mildew a very real threat. However, June finally saw temperatures rise and there were enough sunny days to dry out the vines, reducing the risk of disease. Although June's warmth prompted an early flowering, regional hail, however, than struck which again caused damage.  Heavy rain suddenly became the order of the day with little sunshine – or relief – throughout both July and August, this meant vignerons had to be vigilant when it came to keeping both rot and disease at bay. The weather finally eased before véraison and the fruit was finally allowed to dry out. Although the fruit did ripen – unusually the reds were quicker to ripen then the whites – the earlier stresses of hail, frost and rain had taken their toll resulting in one of Burgundy's smallest ever vintages.  Overall, it is likely that the 2021 vintage for Burgundy will be far more a vintage for reds than for whites as yields for whites were heavily reduced – although yields for reds were not high either. The quality of what was made, however, is said to be very good. One thing perhaps going in favor of this vintage is that the cooler-than-usual growing season failed to beat high alcohol into the grapes – as has been the case in recent years – leaving instead an arguably more refined style more closely aligned with classic Burgundy.  It is likely that the 2021 vintage will be very pleasing to Burgundy purists, however, as it was so small, the best examples of what was made are likely to cost an arm and a leg. The reduced supply will likely mean limited availability, so for those with a penchant for cool-climate Burgundy, be ready to both act quick and pay big.",4600,,,https://anstradingfirm.com/product/2021-charles-van-canneyt-chambertin-clos-de-beze-grand-cru-cote-de-nuits/,4600,,24,"2021 Charles Van Canneyt Chambertin Clos-de-Beze Grand Cru  Cote de Nuits",,"Vintage Notes: The 2021 Burgundy vintage was largely a mixed bag, which is mostly down to the wild and unpredictable weather that blighted the growing season.

The mouth is full of life with an incomparable richness, a generosity which is sometimes overwhelming. To the Eye: Everything depends on the vintage and the age of the bottle. A Richebourg can be a velvety ruby colour or a dark nocturnal red, shading towards blackish purple. The colour is always intense and dense, luminous and shot through with gleams of carmine. To the Nose: When young, this wine reveals aromas of musk and Russian leather, with touches of sandalwood. With age it acquires scents of hawthorn and peachblossom. Two aromatic families can be distinguished: hints of lichen, woodland undergrowth and mushrooms on the one hand, on the other the scent of cherries, blackcurrants, cooked or preserved fruits.

The growing season got off to a fine start with a spectacularly warm April, but then conditions abruptly changed. Cool, damp weather set in for the duration of the summer and the endless dank days allowed both mildew and grey rot to take hold. The white wine appellations of Chassagne-Montrachet, Montrachet and Saint-Aubin also suffered from intense hailstorms, which massively cut yields. Producers had to exercise constant vigilance until conditions eventually changed late August when the sun finally emerged to dry out the vines. The warm weather continued into September ushering the grapes to phenolic ripeness, while benevolent winds dried out the grapes and freed them from rot. This late boon of good weather ultimately rescued the vintage from potential disaster.  The harvest was generally successful, although careful sorting was essential, however, the resulting wines were a mixed bag. In general, the wines favored plush fruit overweight and structure, and it was arguably more a year for whites than reds.  Regarding the reds, the Pinot Noir tended to be fresh, with bright forest fruit and aromatics, with some even exhibiting an attractive mineral streak. However, the biggest drawback was some did lack a touch of depth along with the capacity for long-term aging. Some excellent wines, particularly grand crus, emerged from Gevrey-Chambertins and Morey-St-Denis in the Côte de Nuits, and some shining examples were also made from various appellations in the Côte de Beaune, particularly from Santenay, Volnay, Pommard and Beaune.  The cooler growing season served the whites particularly well preserving their fresh aromatic fruit character and acidity. Producers who waited a little to capitalize on the Indian summer were rewarded with deeper flavors and some wines even developed enough weight and body to suit long-term aging. The wines from the Cote d'Or were excellent but the wines of Chablis delivered above and beyond. Overall, the year was uniformly brilliant for whites.  In general, although the year for Burgundy stopped short of outstanding, some excellent wines were made, particularly whites.

Although many of the wines may be coming close to the end or have gone past their ideal drinking windows, the best examples may still drink well now.","White Wine|France|Burgundy|750ml",,"2007 Au Pied du Mont Chauve Le Charmois Blanc Saint-Aubin Premier Cru","Classification: Saint-Aubin Premier Cru Alcohol ABV: 13 - 14.5%","Vintage Notes:  For Burgundy, the 2007 vintage had some highlights.  The growing season got off to a fine start with a spectacularly warm April, but then conditions abruptly changed. Cool, damp weather set in for the duration of the summer and the endless dank days allowed both mildew and grey rot to take hold. The white wine appellations of Chassagne-Montrachet, Montrachet and Saint-Aubin also suffered from intense hailstorms, which massively cut yields. Producers had to exercise constant vigilance until conditions eventually changed late August when the sun finally emerged to dry out the vines. The warm weather continued into September ushering the grapes to phenolic ripeness, while benevolent winds dried out the grapes and freed them from rot. This late boon of good weather ultimately rescued the vintage from potential disaster.  The harvest was generally successful, although careful sorting was essential, however, the resulting wines were a mixed bag. In general, the wines favored plush fruit overweight and structure, and it was arguably more a year for whites than reds.  Regarding the reds, the Pinot Noir tended to be fresh, with bright forest fruit and aromatics, with some even exhibiting an attractive mineral streak. However, the biggest drawback was some did lack a touch of depth along with the capacity for long-term aging. Some excellent wines, particularly grand crus, emerged from Gevrey-Chambertins and Morey-St-Denis in the Côte de Nuits, and some shining examples were also made from various appellations in the Côte de Beaune, particularly from Santenay, Volnay, Pommard and Beaune.  The cooler growing season served the whites particularly well preserving their fresh aromatic fruit character and acidity. Producers who waited a little to capitalize on the Indian summer were rewarded with deeper flavors and some wines even developed enough weight and body to suit long-term aging. The wines from the Cote d'Or were excellent but the wines of Chablis delivered above and beyond. Overall, the year was uniformly brilliant for whites.  In general, although the year for Burgundy stopped short of outstanding, some excellent wines were made, particularly whites.

The 2020 vintage was unusual for two reasons: first the Covid pandemic that swept the world, and then for its unusually high temperatures, a possible result of climate change.  The growing season began with an unusually mild winter, which transitioned into a balmy spring. However, despite the relative warmth, various bouts of frost struck in the subsequent months with Chablis particularly affected although damage was kept to a minimum. Consistent warm weather eventually prevailed, cumulating into an unnaturally warm April, which prompted both an early budburst and flowering. For some places like the Côte d'Or, this set the scene for a rapid growing season.  A hot, dry summer eventually arrived, and conditions became so arid at times that drought became a looming threat – although cleansing winds breezed through the vineyards, which helped keep the vines free from disease. The conditions tended to be more conducive to the successful development of Pinot Noir, which experienced fewer problems with millerandage and coulure than Chardonnay.  The dry summer heat was, at times, taxing on the grapes and by August vines were beginning to suffer, although there were a few patches of localized rain, which helped relieve regions like Chablis. One advantage of the dry conditions was that it prevented hail from making an appearance along with diseases like rot and mildew that rely on a certain level of moisture being present.  Producers had to manage a different set of problems from previous years where disease can be more prevalent. This year, producers had to be on the watch out for sunburned grapes and overly raisined fruit.  The fast-growing season naturally led to an early harvest with picking beginning in the Mâconnais mid-August and some estates even had the entire harvest for both red and white in by the end of the month, which is almost unheard of. Another unique aspect was the order of picking, traditionally whites are nearly always picked first as they tend to ripen before the reds but, in this instance, Chardonnay was slower in reaching full phenolic ripeness than Pinot Noir and the reds were mostly picked first. Additionally, there were the extra precautions like social distancing put in place to tackle Covid, which had to be adhered to during picking.  Although the harvest was not a unanimous success as some producers lost significant yields, particularly Pinot Noir, to the intense summer heat, the quality of the surviving grapes looks set to be high.  On balance, producers have high hopes for their wines. The whites are said to be both aromatic and fresh, while the reds are said to be both complex and structured, if a little higher in alcohol than normal.  Overall, the 2020 vintage was an interesting year for Burgundy as the region had to contend with both an arid growing season and a global pandemic which made having general tastings difficult. However, the general feeling remains one of optimism particularly when it comes to the whites which could prove to be the region's winning card.",324,,,https://anstradingfirm.com/product/2020-athenais-bourgogne-chardonnay-burgundy/,324,,6,"2020 Athenais Bourgogne Chardonnay Burgundy",,"Vintage Notes:  Although it is still too early to give a definitive assessment on the vintage, most reports suggest the 2020 Burgundy vintage is shaping up to be superb.

They are pressed in a pneumatic press, following strict proportions: 150kg of pressed grapes must give a maximum of 100 litres of musts. The juice ferments in stainless steel tanks, after settling naturally for around 24 hours. Once the alcoholic and malolactic fermentation achieved, basis wines are blended, bottled and sealed with crown caps, with an adding of sugar and yeasts, to have a third bottle fermentation occur, that will produce CO2 and what we call “Prise de Mousse”.  Ageing: Bottles are stored horizontally in our cellars and will age on lees during at least 12 months at a regulated temperature between 12 and 15°C. Next, bottles are settled on their tips and riddled on gyropallets, in order to force down the deposit of lees in the neck of the bottles.

The bounty of colors and the complexity of this exquisite watercolor perfectly complement the 2013 wine Heidi has crafted for you. We are very fortunate to have known LeRoy for nearly ten years. This painting is one of his final works.  Vintage Notes:  California had an exceptional 2013 vintage.  A mild, dry spring got the growing season off to an early start and ultimately delivered an equally early harvest. The summer was balmy and smooth and had few, if any, hiccups despite being extremely hot and dry. The generally perfect conditions saw most grape varieties ripen quickly and evenly; even Cabernet Sauvignon was hot on the heels of earlier-ripening varieties, meaning many producers had to struggle with a glut of grapes when it came to harvest time.  Barring some September rainstorms in the Anderson Valley, problems were few and far between and the harvest was fast and vastly ahead of time. With the state being knees deep in drought, the lack of water meant what fruit the vines did produce tended to be tiny in size and intensely concentrated resulting in a superb vintage.  Almost every region excelled producing sophisticated reds with rich tannin and the complexity to age. Both the Napa Valley and Sonoma produced some fantastic Cabernet Sauvignons and Pinot Noir and Rhône grape varieties were also extremely successful throughout the state. The only noticeable flaw in some was a slightly overripe or overly extracted character.  The whites were also very successful with Sonoma, Santa Barbara and the Santa Cruz Mountains producing some great Chardonnays. The whites tended to be refined, with focused fruit and a strong mineral edge.  Overall, California had an incredible 2013 vintage producing noteworthy examples of both reds and whites.

Vintage Notes:  For California, the 2014 vintage was small but fantastic.  The region enjoyed a long, steady growing season with few hiccups despite a large earthquake in August. The winter was mild and very dry, although rain in February and March relieved some of the stress but as the state was in the grip of a long-term drought, this was but a sticking plaster.  The balmy conditions continued to kick off a rapid growing season with both budburst and flowering occurring early. The summer was steady but moderate with temperatures never reaching dizzying heights which allowed the grapes to retain their fresh fruit character and acidity. The drought particularly affected regions like Paso Robles and yields were cut significantly. However, one benefit of the water shortages was that the berries that did survive tended to be richly concentrated. The relatively steady and uneventful growing season led to an early harvest.  In general, the resulting wines were extremely good with some starry standouts.

Napa Cabernet Sauvignon, although slightly lighter than in previous years, was still very good with elegance and depth.

The balance of the must is fermented in stainless steel and concrete tanks which preserves the freshness of the fruit. Following judicious extended skin contact, the wine was pressed and returned to barrels for malolactic fermentation and aging. A small amount of Petit Verdot and Malbec were blended with the Cabernet Sauvignon to further enhance the wine’s aroma and flavor profile.  Producer Notes: When André Tchelistcheff joined Beaulieu Vineyard in 1938, he tasted the de Latour family’s private wine – what they called “Private Reserve” – from the 1936 vintage. This Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine was so distinctive that Tchelistcheff insisted it be bottled and sold as the winery’s flagship offering. In 1940, Beaulieu Vineyard released the first vintage of Private Reserve and named it in our founder’s honor. The resulting wine became the first release of Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, a wine that was destined to become Napa Valley’s first “cult” Cabernet. In 70  years since, Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon has become the benchmark of Napa Valley Cabernet as one of the most collected American wines.  Vineyard Notes: We hand selected grapes from the finest Cabernet Sauvignon vines from the western bench of the Rutherford AVA in our iconic BV Ranches No. 1 and No. 2, originally planted by Georges de Latour in the early 1900s. We focused on clonal selections (6, 4, 169, 7 and 8), which yield small berries with the high skin-to-juice ratio needed to make intense, long-lived wines. The fruit was handpicked and optically sorted once it arrived to the winery in order to ensure the highest quality selection. These specifically chosen vines are deeply rooted in the well-draining alluvial fan soils of Rutherford, considered one of the finest regions in the Napa Valley for Cabernet Sauvignon.  Ageing:  22 months of aging in French oak (95% new barrels). We work very closely with our barrel producers, being highly selective in the limited number of cooperages we use, as well as ensuring the style and consistency of the barrel is exactly right and an appropriate match to the style we’re aiming for when crafting our Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon.

The growing season saw the full force of nature’s wrath from searing heatwaves to raging bushfires, which brought the inevitable problems with smoke taint.  The growing season began with an unusually warm winter, which morphed into a hot, dry spring and problems from drought entered early into the picture affecting yields. Some regions were lucky to enjoy an ideal mix of cool mornings followed by warm dry days, however, these easy conditions were not set to last.  The culmination of various heatwaves and lightning strikes eventually caused California to burst into flames, as some of the most serious wildfires in state's history broke out. The two most serious fires, the LNU Lightning Complex fire and the Glass fire, broke out in August and September respectively, throwing the growing season into disarray. The fires did not discriminate, affecting vineyards from Sonoma and Napa County where the devastating Glass fire took place, all the way down to Santa Cruz.  As a result, many buildings and vineyards like Cain Vineyard & Winery and Chateau Boswell Winery were either damaged or completely lost to the flames. Although the damage dealt to wineries varied wildly, with some hardly touched while others were ravaged, collectively the human and financial cost was massive. Asides from the considerable damage to buildings, winery equipment and vineyards, many producers also lost large portions of their grapes to smoke taint with red wine grapes particularly vulnerable.  On top of the chaos and devastation delivered by the wildfires, the Covid pandemic delivered even more in the way of complication as vineyard workers had to socially distance at all times when it came to picking what had survived the fires.  Between the wildfires and the pandemic, California endured an annus horribilis but the region is resolutely resilient and producers have continued to push through. Although yields were cut short, particularly for red wines, there were some success stories as the intensely dry, low-yielding growing season helped deliver some intensely concentrated grapes, many of which will have escaped the effects of smoke taint.

In the vineyards, hand-harvesting and other traditional approaches are taken wherever they work best. When modern techniques benefit the winegrowing process, they are researched, evaluated and integrated into practice.  Vintage Notes: Already slowed by El Niño’s winter flooding, the growing season of 1998 was the coolest Opus One has seen since 1991. With foggy mornings and moderate temperatures recorded during summer, the season extended into late October, promoting slow ripening and a very long “hang time” for Opus One’s grapes. Excellent weather in September and October made for an orderly harvest of Opus One’s five classic Bordeaux varietals.  Winemaking: 36 days Skin Contact.

In the mouth, the texture is velvety and loaded with black currant, cassis liqueur, game, blackberry, black olives, coconut, and plum, with an iron-like minerality and gunpowder notes. The finish is round, refined, complex and meaty with incredible length. This wine will continue to develop and age gracefully for three decades or more.  Producer Notes: Located in the heart of the Oakville AVA’s famed red dirt in Napa Valley, 'Au Paradis' is exactly where its name translates, ""In Heaven."" Planted in the foothills on the east side of the valley on a raised, gently sloping plateau, the Bordeaux varietals develop into a classic style with silky tannins and deep red fruit. Between 500 and 600 feet, 26 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot look down on the valley and across to the Mayacamas Mountains. The slope and hillside location provide ideal sun exposure during the day and help develop the lush, intense fruit one would expect from such a magnificent property.  Vintage Notes: The 2013 growing season began with a dry spring and mild temperatures, very similar to the previous vintage. Bloom occurred evenly under excellent conditions, setting an ample crop. With the exception of one heat spike in late June, temperatures were consistently optimal, resulting in notably healthy vines. Meticulous canopy management and substantial crop thinning, brought the vines into perfect balance. From veraison to the harvest, a long Indian summer contributed to the exceptional quality of the vintage. Sunny days, followed by cool evenings allowed for even, slow ripening.

In the mouth, the texture is velvety and loaded with black currant, cassis liqueur, game, blackberry, black olives, coconut, and plum, with an iron-like minerality and gunpowder notes. The finish is round, refined, complex and meaty with incredible length. This wine will continue to develop and age gracefully for three decades or more.  Producer Notes: Located in the heart of the Oakville AVA’s famed red dirt in Napa Valley, 'Au Paradis' is exactly where its name translates, ""In Heaven."" Planted in the foothills on the east side of the valley on a raised, gently sloping plateau, the Bordeaux varietals develop into a classic style with silky tannins and deep red fruit. Between 500 and 600 feet, 26 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot look down on the valley and across to the Mayacamas Mountains. The slope and hillside location provide ideal sun exposure during the day and help develop the lush, intense fruit one would expect from such a magnificent property.  Vintage Notes: The 2013 growing season began with a dry spring and mild temperatures, very similar to the previous vintage. Bloom occurred evenly under excellent conditions, setting an ample crop. With the exception of one heat spike in late June, temperatures were consistently optimal, resulting in notably healthy vines. Meticulous canopy management and substantial crop thinning, brought the vines into perfect balance. From veraison to the harvest, a long Indian summer contributed to the exceptional quality of the vintage. Sunny days, followed by cool evenings allowed for even, slow ripening.

Vivid on the nose, fresh notes of red fruits are surrounded by the characteristic scents of our territory: wet stone, graphite, lichen, and subtle laurel. The entry is gentle and elegant, building naturally into a lively and generous mid-palate. Tannins are voluminous yet gain definition as they flow along the palate, lending strength and length to the wine. Despite its youth, the wine allows itself to be appreciated without hiding its latent potential—a promise for future decades.  Producer Notes: Wines from hillsides of Promontory reflect the many aspects of the territory: the native forests, the moisture of the ephemeral fog, and the minerality of the geologic underpinnings. These disparate facets in symphony provide a natural balance of freshness, energy, and tannin. We believe these traits, in wine, are the building blocks of great vitality and long life.  Vintage Notes: After a dry and unusually warm winter, budbreak occurred in the third week of March, indicating an early beginning for the 2015 growing season. Colder weather during flowering led to lower fruit set, which, along with minimal rainfall throughout the previous three years, resulted in small yields. In late summer, several heat spells nudged temperatures above 100 degrees. These incidences were particularly challenging during August and September, and so the vines needed to use all available resources to maintain a regular ripening path. Harvest began very early—September 8th—but the cool climate of the territory tempered trajectories, allowing us to continue harvesting for four weeks. Nearly fifty-four harvest passes were completed, resulting in forty distinct vinifications. The wine showed generosity and balance from the beginning, while maintaining the innate drive so typical of Promontory.

Sweet, well-integrated aromas of white chocolate, cotton candy and dried fruit complete its rich bouquet. On the palate, Solaia 2018 is mouth filling and creamy: soft, silky tannins impart an extremely elegant, lengthy and lingering finish, with a pleasing aftertaste reminiscent of licorice.

Built in 1998, and inaugurated in the year 2000, Almaviva winery is recognized as a perfect integration of both esthetic design and functionality. For its construction, native woods were brought from the south of Chile, interlacing the warmth of indigenous materials with contemporary, modern austerity. The undulating curves of the roof simulate the shape of the Andes Mountains, harmonizing with the surrounding natural landscape. The decoration of its interior is inspired by the native people of Chile, using symbols and artifacts representative of the Mapuche culture throughout the bodega.

It is here that 60 hectares have been reserved exclusively for Almaviva. THE SOIL Featured characteristics of Puente Alto include its rocky, poor soils, which consist of loamy clay down to 50 centimeters, sandy loam, gravel, and rocks below. These alluvial soils allow for proper drainage and impart minerality, as well as lower pH levels, resulting in extraordinary quality, balance and elegance.  Winemaking: Composed of two rooms with stainless steel tanks adapted to the size of each vineyard parcel, the vinification room is where the maceration and alcoholic fermentation take place. The must is first cooled and the juice is left in contact with the skins in order to extract their rich color and aromas, then warmed before the alcoholic fermentation and final maceration take place. The Malolactic Fermentation occurs spontaneously, immediately before or just after the wine is drained off by gravity into new French oak barrels.

Subtle aromas of coffee and Asian spices with a touch of mocha from the oak create a very deep and complex nose. The palate is vibrant and tense with good density and shows multiple layers of fresh fruits, spices, and balsamic notes with a hint of smoke. It displays great freshness and a smooth texture with a long and juicy finish. This is a very elegant and splendidly youthful wine.

In general, winter in 2012 was dry and cold in Apalta, except in June which showed higher temperatures and was also humid (+2ºC versus the last 10 years average). The springtime rains where average. All rains where concentrated in October. Summer was colder and more humid than the historic data. During December, rains of 68.1 mm at Apalta made it the wettest December known in last 10 years. These rains supplied our water reserves and allowed the grapevines to develop without the necessity of extra summer irrigation. Only February brought back normal recorded temperatures. The ripening process occurred slowly but, it was very balanced. Fall and March brought normal conditions. Regarding temperatures, April was going well only the maxima were lower. The grape lost early its vegetal flavors and was technically ready to make wine, but we had to wait for the aromatic and phenolic ripeness.

The growing season, despite the health crisis, was exceptionally good, in stark contrast to other New World wine regions like Australia and California.  Although the Central Otago region experienced an exceptionally cold growing season, the rest of the country enjoyed a relatively easy and smooth ride to harvest time. Most of the country enjoyed a balmy spring, which allowed for both a successful budburst and flowering before the arrival of a warm and extremely dry summer. The dry weather helped keep disease to a minimum and the good weather remained in play till autumn.

The palate is medium-bodied, with lightness and depth, very classical with extra freshness and all that is needed for a long development in bottle. This is the more Tondonia of the two vintages I tasted side by side. There are notes of maple syrup, smoke, licorice and crisp fruit. The palate is more austere, crunchy and reveals the chalkiness of the soils. There's more definition and precision here.</p>
